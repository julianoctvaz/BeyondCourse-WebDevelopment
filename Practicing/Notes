1. Beter use always let instead var
2. node.js interprets code as a browser
node.js is JS runtime builder. 
Actually, it interprets code. But not just that. 
Inside, it has a vitual machine. V8 is a VirtualMachine
basically which has an interpreter and multiple compilers, 
like JIT (just in time compiler), and optimizers.
Node.js has a npm, node package manager. Dependecies, etc.
Node.js allow you to create servers, CLI (command-line interface tool), etc.
3. Be careful with callback (nested functions/code block)
